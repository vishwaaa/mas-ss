AWS API Gatewary
===========================

API Gateway allows you to securely connect mobile and web applications to business logic hosted on AWS Lambda, 
APIs hosted on Amazon EC2, or other publicly addressable web services hosted inside or outside of AWS. 
With API Gateway, you can create and operate APIs for backend services.


Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. 
You can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud.

Controlling Access to an API in API Gateway
====================================
API Gateway supports multiple mechanisms for controlling access to your API:

Resource policies let you create resource-based policies to allow or deny access to your APIs and methods from specified source IP addresses or VPC endpoints.

Standard AWS IAM roles and policies offer flexible and robust access controls that can be applied to an entire API or individual methods.

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) lets you control how your API responds to cross-domain resource requests.

Lambda authorizers are Lambda functions that control access to your API methods using bearer token authentication as well as information described by headers, paths, query strings, stage variables, or context variables request parameters.

Amazon Cognito user pools let you create customizable authentication and authorization solutions.

Client-side SSL certificates can be used to verify that HTTP requests to your backend system are from API Gateway.

Usage plans let you provide API keys to your customers — and then track and limit usage of your API stages and methods for each API key.

Create and Attach a Policy to an IAM User
To enable a user to call the API managing service or the API execution service, you must create an IAM policy for an IAM user, which controls access to the API Gateway entities, and then attach the policy to the IAM user. The following steps describe how to create your IAM policy.

To create your own IAM policy

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console .

Choose Policies, and then choose Create Policy. If a Get Started button appears, choose it, and then choose Create Policy.

Next to Create Your Own Policy, choose Select.

For Policy Name, type any value that is easy for you to refer to later. Optionally, type descriptive text in Description.

For Policy Document, type a policy statement with the following format, and then choose Create Policy:
