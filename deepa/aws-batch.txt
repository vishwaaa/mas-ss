AWS Batch IAM Policies, Roles, and Permissions..?
====================================

By default, IAM users don't have permission to create or modify AWS Batch resources, or perform tasks using the AWS Batch API. 

To allow IAM users to create or modify resources and submit jobs, you must create IAM policies that grant IAM users permission to use the specific resources and API actions they'll need, and then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.


When you attach a policy to a user or group of users, it allows or denies the users permission to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources. 



An IAM policy must grant or deny permissions to use one or more AWS Batch actions.
