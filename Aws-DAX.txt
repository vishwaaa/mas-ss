DAX---security----DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) 
============================================
Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) (service prefix: dax) 

provides the following service-specific resources, actions, and condition context keys for use in IAM permission policies.

DAX is designed to work together with DynamoDB, to seamlessly add a caching layer to your applications.

 However, DAX and DynamoDB are separate AWS services. 
Even though both services use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to implement their respective security policies, the security models for DAX and DynamoDB are different.
==================================================
Use Cases for DAX
DAX provides access to eventually consistent data from DynamoDB tables, with microsecond latency. A multi-AZ DAX cluster can serve millions of requests per second.
=======================================================

With DynamoDB, you can create IAM policies that limit the actions a user can perform on individual DynamoDB resources.

For example, you can create a user role that only allows the user to perform read-only actions on a particular DynamoDB table. (For more information.

----------------

the DAX security model focuses on cluster security, and the ability of the cluster to perform DynamoDB API actions on your behalf.

=========================================================
Warning :: De-merits  of DAX
---------------------------------------

DAX does not enforce user-level separation on data in DynamoDB. Instead,
 users inherit the permissions of the DAX cluster's IAM policy when they access that cluster. 
Thus, when accessing DynamoDB tables via DAX, the only access controls that are in effect are the permissions in the DAX cluster's IAM policy. No other permissions are recognized.

If you require isolation, we recommend that you create additional DAX clusters and scope the IAM policy for each cluster accordingly. 
For example, you could create multiple DAX clusters and allow each cluster to access only a single table.
=========================================================
IAM Service Role for DAX

When you create a DAX cluster, you must associate the cluster with an IAM role. This is known as the service role for the cluster.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM Policy to Allow DAX Cluster Access
Once you have created a DAX cluster, you need to grant permissions to an IAM user so that the user can access the DAX cluster.

------------------------------------
example of accessing the Dynamo DB table :
An IAM user (mahesh).

An IAM role (maheshUserRole). Bob assumes this role at runtime.

An IAM policy (BobAccessPolicy). This policy is attached to BobUserRole. BobAccessPolicy defines the DynamoDB and DAX resources that BobUserRole is allowed to access.

A DAX cluster (DAXCluster01).

An IAM service role (DAXServiceRole). This role allows DAXCluster01 to access DynamoDB.

An IAM policy (DAXAccessPolicy). This policy is attached to DAXServiceRole. DAXAccessPolicy defines the DynamoDB APIs and resources that DAXCluster01 is allowed to access.
