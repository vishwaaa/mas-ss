================================================
AWS Elastic Beanstalk automates the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, and application deployment, creating an environment that runs a version of your application. 

You can simply upload your deployable code (e.g., WAR file), and AWS Elastic Beanstalk does the rest.


What are the Cloud resources powering my AWS Elastic Beanstalk application?
===================================================
AWS Elastic Beanstalk uses proven AWS features and services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, Amazon S3, and Amazon SNS, to create an environment that runs your application.

Can I use Amazon S3 to store application data, like images?
========================
Yes. You can use Amazon S3 for application storage. 


Security releated concerts for AWS-Beanstalk ?
===================================
How do I make my application private?

By default, your application is available publicly at myapp.elasticbeanstalk.com for anyone to access. 

You can use Amazon VPC to provision a private, isolated section of your application in a virtual network that you define.

Can I run my application inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?
==============================================

Yes, you can run your applications in a VPC.


Why should I use IAM with AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
===================================
IAM allows you to manage users and groups in a centralized manner. You can control which IAM users have access to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and limit permissions to read-only access to Elastic Beanstalk for operators who should not be able to perform actions against Elastic Beanstalk resources. All user activity within your account will be aggregated under a single AWS bill.


How do I grant an IAM user access to AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
=======================
You can grant IAM users access to services by using policies



 Can I restrict access to specific AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources?
===============================================
Yes. You can allow or deny permissions to specific AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, such as applications, application versions, and environments.


Service Roles, Instance Profiles, and User Policies ??
===================================
When you create an environment, AWS Elastic Beanstalk prompts you to provide two AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles: a service role and an instance profile.


Elastic Beanstalk Service Role
Elastic Beanstalk Instance Profile
Elastic Beanstalk User Policy

Elastic Beanstalk Service Role ?
===========================
A service role is the IAM role that Elastic Beanstalk assumes when calling other services on your behalf.



Elastic Beanstalk Instance Profile ?
=================================
An instance profile is an IAM role that is applied to instances launched in your Elastic Beanstalk environment. When creating an Elastic Beanstalk environment, you specify the instance profile that is used when your instances:

Retrieve application versions from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

Write logs to Amazon S3

In AWS X-Ray integrated environments, upload debugging data to X-Ray

In multicontainer Docker environments, coordinate container deployments with Amazon Elastic Container Service

In worker environments, read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue

In worker environments, perform leader election with Amazon DynamoDB

In worker environments, publish instance health metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.




Elastic Beanstalk User Policy ?
===========================
Create IAM users for each person who uses Elastic Beanstalk to avoid using your root account or sharing credentials. For increased security, only grant these users permission to access services and features that they need.



AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment Security ?
===============================
Elastic Beanstalk provides several options that control the security of your environment and of the Amazon EC2 instances in it.


Configuring Your Environment Security
Environment Security Configuration Namespaces



Configuring Your Environment Security
========================
You can modify your Elastic Beanstalk environment security configuration in the Elastic Beanstalk console.

To configure environment security in the Elastic Beanstalk console

Open the Elastic Beanstalk console.

Navigate to the management page for your environment.

Choose Configuration.



Environment Security Configuration Namespaces 
==================
Elastic Beanstalk provides configuration options in the following namespaces to enable you to customize the security of your environment:

aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment – Configure the environment's service role using the ServiceRole option.

aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration – Configure permissions for the environment's Amazon EC2 instances using the EC2KeyName and IamInstanceProfile options.
On the Security configuration card, choose Modify.

The following settings are available.

Options
